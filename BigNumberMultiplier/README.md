# BigNumberMultiplier
This program multiplies two numbers which may contain infinite number of digits.


Example:

FirstNumber:100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;

SecondNuber:100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;

Output:    :10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000....

Also same results can be computed directly by JAVA BigInteger Class.
